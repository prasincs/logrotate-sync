## Logrotate Sync

**This is WIP**

I wanted a script or something that could sync log files generated by various services, and in particular by kafka, logrotate's standard format into S3 in a relatively flexible way.

The intent is to work with the existing systems and be complete, lightweight and more maintainable than bash scripts to do the same.
